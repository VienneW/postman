# postman
learning how to use postman

Aims: Test API and testcases

Simple as a freak, 
1. set GET, POST, PUT,,....etc
2. I should have an API endpoint
3. add params if necessary 
4. add body if necessary
5. add header
6. writing testcases, which might contains some assertions and info storing as environment variables from other testcases
